        I also played a bit of osu and got really close to 5 digits but then i got lazy 
        and gave up on the grind. Plus I heard it gives you arthritis. Below is my osu 
        profile

        <p>
            I think I am a pretty <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">normal</span>. 
                player. Nothing special. I only started playing games during senior year of highschool
                so I started really late compared to everyone else. I using gaming as a way to hang out
                with friends without wasting gas to get to them since I live pretty far from almost all 
                of them. :/
