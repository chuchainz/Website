            <p>About Me at this school:</p>
            <em>
                Hello, my name is Jimmy Chu and I am a transfer student from Cypress College before
                I came to Cal Poly Pomona. I came in as a majoring in Mechanical Engineering and after
                some courses I felt bored with it and now I am in the process of changing majors to 
                Computer Science. 
            </em>

            <p>Personal Life:</p>
            <em>
                I am technically the third child but fourth child in reality. I have a older step sister and brother
                and a adopted older brother. My siblings are much older than me, the oldest one is almost twice my
                age right now. My dad fought in the vietnam war and was lucky enough to survive the journey to the 
                U.S. as one of the boat people.
